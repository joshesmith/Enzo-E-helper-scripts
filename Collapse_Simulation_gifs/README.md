# Collapse Simulation Animations
A collection of gifs showing the movement of particle mass throughout each self-gravitating particle collapse.
The level number indicates the maximum depth of mesh refinement allowed in the collapse.  
Notice the large errors in the Domain Decomposed (DD) solutions compared to the Analytical BiCGSTAB solutions.  
The 'offset' simulations reduce the error in the DD solution by placing the collapse in the centre of a root grid block
