## Simulating A Spherical Dust Cloud Collapse In Enzo E
The accompanying files to a short research project I undertook at the San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UCSD, running self gravitating particle collapses simulations with the parallel astrophyiscs program Enzo-E.

The directories contain Python helper scripts used to analyse the output of these simulations, and animations of a selection of collapses.
