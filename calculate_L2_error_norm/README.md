# Calculate L2 Error Norm
These two python scripts can be run from the terminal and compare the values between pairs of HDF5 files generated by two Enzo-E simulations. It returns a block by block cut down of the L2 error norm, assuming the first file contains the true values.

*Compare_errors_two_files.py* takes two HDF5 file names (or paths if not in current directory), one field name and one destination text file name as input.   
The input files need to be the exact same block and time-step but from a separate simulation. This means that if the mesh has refined differently in each simulation, it is unlikely a comparison can be successfully made. Static meshes work best for this reason.

*Compare_errors_two_folders.py*, works the same as above, except it takes two directories, not files, as inputs. The directories should contain a collection of HDF5 files for the same blocks and time-steps between two simulations. This script iterates through the files, and calls the compare_errors_two_files.py script on each pair, before finally combining the errors into a global L2 error.
